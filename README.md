# Lyric Scraper

**REQUIRES THE INSTALLATION OF:**
BeautifulSoup - pip install beautifulsoup4

---

Generates an AZLyrics.com link to scrape for lyrics by song and artist.

Some inputs don't work, since their URL has some weird quirks about them.
Examples:
Artist has a dash in the URL (https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/playboi-carti/longtimeintro.html)
Song has a number in the URL (https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/killers/mrbrightside39068.html)

Most inputs should work though.
